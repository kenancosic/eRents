## Key Architecture Components

The eRents desktop application follows a modular, feature-first architecture with clear separation of concerns. The foundation of the application's state management is built on a custom base provider architecture that significantly reduces code duplication and standardizes common functionality across all providers.

### Base Provider Architecture

The foundation of the application's state management is built on a custom base provider architecture that significantly reduces code duplication and standardizes common functionality across all providers.

### Error Handling System

A structured error handling system provides consistent error management across the application with user-friendly messages and retry capabilities.

### Lookup Data Management

Efficient management of reference data used throughout the application with caching, enum synchronization, and type conversion.

## Feature Modules

- **Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and user management
- **Property Management**: Comprehensive property listing, details, and management
- **Lookup Data**: Reference data management with caching
- **Routing**: Navigation with authentication guards
- **Theming**: Material 3 design system implementation

## Best Practices

- **Code Organization**: Feature-first structure with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Base provider architecture for consistent state handling
- **Caching**: Appropriate TTL-based caching for performance
- **Error Handling**: Structured error management with user-friendly messages
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for providers and UI components

## Migration Guide

For developers looking to migrate existing providers to the new base provider architecture, see the [Migration and Testing Strategies](migration_and_testing_strategies.md) document for detailed steps and best practices.

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed for easy extension with new features following established patterns for consistency and maintainability.
