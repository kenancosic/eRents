## Quick Reference Cards

### Base Provider Quick Reference
```dart
// Extending BaseProvider
class MyProvider extends BaseProvider<MyProvider> {
  final MyService _service;
  
  MyProvider(this._service);
  
  // State management
  Future<void> loadData() async {
    await executeWithState(() async {
      // Implementation
    });
  }
  
  // Caching
  Future<List<Item>> loadCachedData() async {
    return await executeWithCache(
      cacheKey: 'my_data',
      fetchFunction: () => _service.fetchData(),
      ttl: Duration(minutes: 5),
    );
  }
}
```

### API Service Quick Reference
```dart
// Using ApiService extensions
final items = await apiService.getListAndDecode<Item>(
  '/api/items',
  (json) => Item.fromJson(json),
);

final item = await apiService.postAndDecode<Item>(
  '/api/items',
  data: requestData,
  decoder: (json) => Item.fromJson(json),
);
```

### CRUD Template Quick Reference
```dart
// Using ListScreen template
ListScreen<MyItem>(
  title: 'My Items',
  fetchItems: (page, pageSize) => provider.loadItems(page, pageSize),
  itemBuilder: (context, item) => MyItemCard(item: item),
  onAdd: () => context.push('/items/add'),
  onEdit: (item) => context.push('/items/edit/${item.id}'),
)
```

### Routing Quick Reference
```dart
// Adding routes with provider injection
GoRoute(
  path: '/items',
  builder: (context, state) => const ItemsScreen(),
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: 'add',
      builder: (context, state) => const AddItemScreen(),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not using BaseProvider**: Always extend BaseProvider for consistent state management
2. **Ignoring caching**: Use executeWithCache for performance optimization
3. **Poor error handling**: Always handle errors at the provider level
4. **Inconsistent UI**: Follow Material 3 design and theming guidelines
5. **Missing documentation**: Update docs with every significant change
6. **Skipping tests**: Write tests for providers, services, and widgets
7. **Hardcoding values**: Use constants and environment variables
8. **Not invalidating cache**: Clear cache when data changes

## Best Practices Summary
